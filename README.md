# Speakr.WebApp
## Tools for speakers to manage their feedback!

# How to collaborate:
I can invite you to a Trello board that has a bunch of bug fixes and features to be added :)

# Building and running locally
For the most part is easy:
- You'll have to create an account in auth0 and populate the ./Secure/auth0.json with your details
- You'll need the Speakr.TalksApi on your local box, please head over to the repo
